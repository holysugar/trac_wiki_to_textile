h1. Trac Wiki to Textile

This is a *very* rough start of a script to help convert Trac wiki syntax to Textile friendly syntax.

To use:

# ruby convert.rb http://example.com/trac/sample/wiki/SomePage

then puts converted text to stdout.

Open each file, copy and paste into GitHub.

h2. Caveats

You still need to look over the markup and fix any mistakes. It isn't perfect by any means, but it will save some time.
